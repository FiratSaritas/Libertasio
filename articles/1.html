        <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">Published on July 15, 2025</p>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>RAVENSBURG, GERMANY — In a surprise decision that has sparked both outrage and curiosity, the small town of Ravensburg has officially banned the wearing of clothes in public spaces from Friday to Sunday, between 12 PM and midnight. The new ordinance, passed unanimously by the town council on Monday, imposes a €100 fine on any resident or visitor found wearing garments of any kind within town limits during those hours.</p>

            <p>Mayor Gabriella Wenderli defended the move at a press conference: “We believe in radical transparency and embracing our natural selves. Clothing has become a symbol of social division, and we’re setting a bold example for unity, diversity, and inclusion.”</p>

            <p>Deputy Mayor Alena Heffmann, who introduced the proposal, echoed his sentiment: “This is about more than just freedom — it’s about fostering a community that isn’t afraid to break down barriers and celebrate diversity and inclusion in a meaningful way.”</p>

            <p>The ordinance includes an exception specifically addressing women’s health needs, allowing for minimal coverings or sanitary garments during menstruation. “We consulted with local women’s groups to ensure the law respects personal dignity and bodily autonomy,” Hoffmann added.</p>

            <p>Reactions in Ravensburg have been sharply divided. Some residents have hailed the decision as a progressive step toward openness, while others see it as an overreach. “I’m all for freedom,” said local shopkeeper Tobias Lenz, “but I’m not sure this is the kind of diversity we need on a Saturday afternoon.”</p>

            <p>Legal experts remain skeptical about how such a law will be enforced. Nevertheless, the town council insists the measure will undergo a six-month trial before formal review. Modesty zones will remain in place near schools, churches, and elderly care homes.</p>

            <p>As Heffmann concluded in her statement, “Ravensburg is ready to celebrate diversity and inclusion — in every sense of the word.”</p>
