        CENTRAL TEXAS — In early July 2025, Central Texas, particularly the Hill
        Country, experienced one of the deadliest inland floods in U.S.
        history. From July 4 to 7, a mesoscale convective vortex carrying
        tropical moisture from Tropical Storm Barry and Pacific remnants dumped
        up to 20.33 inches of rain in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Torrential rains caused the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically—nearly
        29 feet in under an hour in parts of Hunt and Kerrville. Flash flood
        emergencies were issued for several counties, including Kerr and Mason.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official death toll has surpassed 134, with at least 107 fatalities
        in Kerr County alone, and over 101 people remain missing. Hundreds were
        rescued, including dozens of campers at Camp Mystic near Hunt where
        more than 20 children were initially reported missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        State and federal emergency responses mobilised more than 2,000
        volunteers and multiple rescue teams, including U.S. Coast Guard
        swimmers who reached over 850 people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event has been compared to the Big Thompson River disaster of 1976,
        marking this as the deadliest inland flash flood in nearly 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared disaster zones for several counties,
        and President Trump signed a federal declaration for Kerr County.
        Authorities caution that continued heavy rain and flash flood watches
        remain in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        With significant gaps in early warning systems and the removal of Camp
        Mystic from federal flood maps in recent years, officials are now
        facing intense scrutiny over preparedness and land-use decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As search and recovery continue, the scale of this disaster serves as a
        sharp reminder of changing weather patterns intensified by tropical
        remnants and raises urgent questions about infrastructure investment
        and climate adaptation.
